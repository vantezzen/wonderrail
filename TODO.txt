- 

Local Attraction Recommendations: The system could use freely available tourist data from Wikitravel/Wikipedia to suggest must-see attractions and points of interest at each location.

Travel Journal: A feature that allows users to document their journey, upload photos, write thoughts, and experiences. This can be shared with others if the user chooses.

Train Station Amenities Information: Information about what amenities are available at each train station (WiFi, food, restrooms, etc). OpenStreetMap could be a potential source for such data.

Integration with Health Apps: Allow users to sync their travel with health apps to show how much they walked or how many stairs they climbed during their trip.

Backlog:
- Add notes to trips
- Different currency 
- "include optional reservations for more than N hour long trains" button
- highlight reservation free alternatives
- clearer option on who actually runs the train you are looking at

- Better findability for calendar and todo list
- Make sure travel days get calculated correctly
- For long train rides:
  - Recommend splitting trip and staying somewhere in between
  - Recommend looking at buying a separate train instead or flying
- Night train support?
