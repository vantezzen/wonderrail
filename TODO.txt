Local Attraction Recommendations: The system could use freely available tourist data from Wikitravel/Wikipedia to suggest must-see attractions and points of interest at each location.

Language Assistance: Include common phrases and basic vocabulary in the local language of each destination. You can use free language datasets or libraries like T2T (Tensor2Tensor) from Google.

Travel Journal: A feature that allows users to document their journey, upload photos, write thoughts, and experiences. This can be shared with others if the user chooses.

Train Station Amenities Information: Information about what amenities are available at each train station (WiFi, food, restrooms, etc). OpenStreetMap could be a potential source for such data.
