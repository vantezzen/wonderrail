          Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis
          (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
          periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set&nbsp;either
          on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription
          plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
          renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it
          or&nbsp;WonderRail&nbsp;cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
          renewal either through your online account management page or by
          contacting&nbsp;WonderRail&nbsp;customer support team.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          A valid payment method, including&nbsp;credit card or PayPal, is
          required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall
          provide&nbsp;WonderRail&nbsp;with accurate and complete billing
          information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone
          number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such
          payment information, you automatically
          authorize&nbsp;WonderRail&nbsp;to charge all Subscription fees
          incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any
          reason,&nbsp;WonderRail&nbsp;will issue an electronic invoice
          indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline
          date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as
          indicated on the invoice.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free
          Trial, you will not be charged by&nbsp;WonderRail&nbsp;until Free
          Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you
          cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the
          applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have
          selected.

          will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          WonderRail&nbsp;will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any
          change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate
          your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into
